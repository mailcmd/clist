# RList

  RList (Rotating List) allow to work with circular lists. A circular lists is a finite list that
  can be traversed as if it were infinite. This is possible because in a circular list, it is
  assumed that a copy of the original list is inserted at the end of the list, and so on infinitely.

  Internally a RList is a map that store the original list and a pointer indicating the current
  position in base 1 (as Erlang lists).

  Although internally an RList is a map, its visual representation (IO.inspect) is:

  ```elixir
  iex> RList.new([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  #RList[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]/1
  ```
  The original list and pointer will always be displayed. If you move the pointer the representation
  look different but internally the original list will be mantained.

  ```elixir
  iex> rl = RList.new([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  #RList[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]/1

  iex> rl2 = RList.forward(rl)
  #RList[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]/2

  iex> RList.equals?(rl, rl2)
  true
  ```
  As you can see, both the list and the pointer differ, but the RLists are equals because their
  original lists are the same.

  It is necessary to clarify what the pointer value means. When the pointer is, for example, 2, it
  means that the first value in the current list is equivalent to the value with index 2 in the
  original list (remember, indexes in RList work on a base 1).

  ```elixir
  ## When pointer is 1 you see the original list
  #RList[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]/1
            ^
            |
            路----------------------------------------------路
                                                           |
  ## When pointer is not 1 you see the list rotatated      |
  #RList[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]/2                                  |
                        |                                  |
                        路----------------------------------路

  ```

  ## Enumerable

  RList implements Enumerable so you can play with them as Streams or use the Enum.* functions.

  ```elixir
  iex> rl = RList.new([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  #RList[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]/1

  iex> Enum.take(rl, 20)
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `rlist` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rlist, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
